## <p align="center">Hello there üïπÔ∏è</p>

My name is **Kasper Wissendorf**, currently studying to become a **Software Developer** at [![Icon](/icons/Dania.png)eaDania Skive](https://eadania.com/). <br>
I like coding in my spare time and enjoy learning new `Coding Languages`. I will also try to upload some projects that I make, that I find interesting. I will also upload assignments that I have been given by my teachers, exam projects that can be shared freely. 

Below here you will find some of my socials that you can use to get in contact with me!
