## <p align="center">Hello there 🕹️</p>

My name is **Kasper Wissendorf**, currently studying to become a **Software Developer** at [![Icon](/icons/Dania.png)eaDania Skive](https://eadania.com/). <br>
I enjoy coding in my spare time and I find learning new `Coding Languages👨‍💻` exciting!<br/>
On this GitHub Profile, I will upload some **projects📦** that I personally create. I will also upload **assignments📝** that I have been given by my teachers and **exam projects🎓** that can be shared freely. 

Below here you will find some of my *socials* that you can use to get in contact with me!
